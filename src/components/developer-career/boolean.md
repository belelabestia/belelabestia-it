### February 2023 - July 2023 | Boolean

From February to July 2023 I worked as tutor and main teacher for [Boolean](https://boolean.careers/). Here I helped students learn the basics of web development and held a full C# and OOP course.

The main topics I trated are:

- HTML, CSS and the basics of web pages
- JavaScript and the basics of programming languages
- C# and OOP principles
- .NET and ASP.NET as backend technology

I also co-hosted the Boolean Coding Week, a free webinar showcasing what can be accomplished with basics web skills.
