### February 2023 - July 2023 | Zerouno

From February to July 2023 I worked as senior dev for [Zerouno](https://www.zerouno.it/). I contributed building the next generation of their main product and developing ad-hoc projects for their customers, as well as taking care of their DevOps platform.

I worked mainly on Angular projects and developing GitLab CI/CD features on Docker containers.
